## JSON.cpp

JSON.cpp is a basic JSON handler built for cpp98. I don't know why you would want to use cpp98 but if you are, this is just for you.

Implements the basic types for JSON objects: Null, Boolean, Number (int and double), String, Arrays and Objects.

Also, as a bonus, recreates the nullptr keyword and its type nullptr_t, renamed to ft_nullptr and ft_nullptr_t.
